C - Dynamic libraries:

this project is basically to create dynamic library in linux. Dynamic library provides a means to use code that can be loaded anywhere in memory.

0. Create the dynamic library libdynamic.so containing all the the given functis in this project.

1. Create a script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory.

2. I know, you’re missing C when coding in Python. So let’s fix that!
Create a dynamic library that contains C functions that can be called from Python. See example for more detail.

3. I bought a ticket for the Giga Millions and chose these numbers: 9, 8, 10, 24, 75 + 9. If you could run two commands on the same server where the Giga Millions program runs, could you make me win the Jackpot?
